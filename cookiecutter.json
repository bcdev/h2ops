If you do not, a folder names `mlflow_artifacts` will be created locally where the models will be stored. To store the data, you would have to now either store it locally or on AWS S3 if you do not choose the MinIO option.\n\nShow examples: Do you want to see the out-of-the-box airflow examples along with an example ML project working end-to-end? These examples would be visible in the Airflow UI. (Highly recommeded for first time users!!)\n\nUse Dag-factory: Do you want to use the dag-factory tool to create DAGs using a config file? If not, you would have to create your own DAGs in python. Examples will be provided for the method that you choose. Use dag-factory either when\n  i) you like .yml configuration files more than Python.\n  ii) you have tried the Pythonic way of creating DAGs and would now like to switch to something simpler\nUse the python version of creating dags; well, if you like working in Python.\n\nFolder name: By default, we will provide you with a folder name based on your project name. If you don't like it, you can change it in this option.\n\nPackage Name: Please provide a package name where you will develop your project. It should be different than the folder name.\n\n[Please press enter to continue]",
