# H2Ops: MLOps Project Template

[![Unittest H2Ops](https://github.com/bcdev/h2ops/actions/workflows/unittest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bcdev/h2ops/actions/workflows/unittest.yml)

H2Ops blends "H₂O" (water) with "Ops" (denoting MLOps), embodying an MLOps framework designed for 
the streamlined operation of water-focused Earth Observation projects. It would
manage the complete pipeline for remote sensing applications centered on water
services using these powerful tools.

It is a comprehensive template (_in-development_) for machine learning projects
incorporating MLOps practices using `Airflow`, `MLFlow`, `JupyterLab` and `Minio`.


The architecture below describes what we want to achieve as our MLOps framework.
This is taken from the [Google Cloud Architecture Centre](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning#mlops_level_2_cicd_pipeline_automation)

Currently what we support is the within the box outlined as local MLOps.

**Please note**: 
This template has only been tested on Linux Ubuntu and it works as expected.
As we have not tested it yet on Windows, we are not sure if it works in there.

## Overview

This template provides a standardized project structure for ML initiatives at BC,
integrating essential MLOps tools:
- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating ML pipelines and workflows
- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking and model registry
- **JupyterLab**: For interactive development and experimentation
- **MinIO**: For local object storage for ML artifacts

## Project Structure from this template

You will get the following project when you use this template to get started with
your ML project.

Any files or folders marked with `*` are off-limits—no need to change, modify, 
or even worry about them. Just focus on the ones without the mark!

## ML Pipeline Overview

Before you get started, let's explore the tools that we are using for this 
standardized MLOps framework 

### 0. Cookiecutter
Purpose: Project scaffolding and template generation

    Provides a standardized way to create ML projects with predefined structures.
    Ensures consistency across different ML projects within BC


### 1. Apache Airflow

Purpose: Workflow orchestration

    Manages and schedules data pipelines.
    Automates end-to-end ML workflows, including data ingestion, training, deployment and re-training.
    Provides a user-friendly web interface for tracking task execution's status.

#### Airflow UI




https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7a76c27-2f38-489f-9798-d0af4ac7619b






- **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**: A workflow representation in Airflow. You 
can enable, disable, and trigger DAGs from the UI.
- **Graph View**: Visual representation of task dependencies.
- **Tree View**: Displays DAG execution history over time.
- T**ask Instance**: A single execution of a task in a DAG.
- **Logs**: Each task's execution details and errors.
- **Code View**: Shows the Python code of a DAG.
- **Trigger DAG**: Manually start a DAG run.
- **Pause DAG**: Stops automatic DAG execution.

Common Actions

- **Enable a DAG**: Toggle the On/Off button.
- **Manually trigger a DAG**: Click Trigger DAG ▶️.
- **View logs**: Click on a task instance and select Logs.
- **Restart a failed task**: Click Clear to rerun a specific task.

### 2. MLflow

Purpose: Experiment tracking and model management

    Tracks and records machine learning experiments, including hyperparameters, performance metrics, and model artifacts.
    Facilitates model versioning and reproducibility.
    Supports multiple deployment targets, including cloud platforms, Kubernetes, and on-premises environments.

#### MLFlow UI

- **Experiments**: Group of runs tracking different versions of ML models.
- **Runs**: A single execution of an ML experiment with logged parameters, 
metrics, and artifacts.
- **Parameters**: Hyperparameters or inputs logged during training.
- **Metrics**: Performance indicators like accuracy or loss.
- **Artifacts**: Files such as models, logs, or plots.
- **Model Registry**: Centralized storage for trained models with versioning.

Common Actions

- **View experiment runs**: Go to Experiments > Select an experiment
- **Compare runs**: Select multiple runs and click Compare.
- **View parameters and metrics**: Click on a run to see details.
- **View registered model**: Under Artifacts, select a model and click Register 
Model.

### 3. JupyterLab

Purpose: Interactive development environment

    Provides an intuitive and interactive web-based interface for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and model development.

### 4. MinIO

Purpose: Object storage for ML artifacts

    Acts as a cloud-native storage solution for datasets and models.
    Provides an S3-compatible API for seamless integration with ML tools.

## Getting Started

Please make sure that you install the following from the links provided as they
have been tried and tested.

If you face any issues, please check out the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting)

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- [Mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) - Please make sure you 
install `Python 3.12` as this repository has been tested with that version.

#### Docker and Docker compose plugin Installation

Please follow the steps mentioned in this [link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)

This should install both Docker and Docker compose plugin.
You can verify the installation by these commands
```bash
   docker --version
   docker compose version
```
and output would be something like:
```commandline
  Docker version 27.5.1, build 9f9e405
  Docker Compose version v2.32.4
```
This means now you have successfully installed Docker. 

## Installation

1. Create a separate environment for cookiecutter
```bash
  mamba create -n cc cookiecutter
  mamba activate cc
```

2. Generate the project from template:
```bash
  cookiecutter https://github.com/bcdev/h2ops
```

When prompted for input, enter the details requested. If you dont provide any 
input for a given choice, the first choice from the list is taken as the default.

Once the project is created, please read the README.md from that.


## Troubleshooting


1. If you face issue like `Docker Daemon not started`, start it using:
```bash
  sudo systemctl start docker
```
and try the docker commands again in a new terminal.


2. If you face an issue as follows:
`Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at 
unix:///var/run/docker.sock: `,
do the following
```bash
  sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```
and try the docker commands again in a new terminal.


3. If you face an issue like
`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///home//.docker/desktop/docker.sock. 
Is the docker daemon running?`,
it is likely because of you have two contexts of docker running.

To view the docker contexts,
```bash
   docker context ls
```
This will show the list of docker contexts. Check if default is enabled (it 
should have a * beside it)
If not, you might probably have desktop as your context enabled.
To confirm which context you are in:
```bash
   docker context show
```

To use the default context, do this:
```bash
   docker context use default
```

Check for the following file:
```bash
  cat ~/.docker/config.json
```
If it is empty, all good, if not, it might be something like this:
```
  {
	"auths": {},
	"credsStore": "desktop"
  }
```
Completely move this file away from this location or delete it and try running 
docker again.

4. If you face some permissions issues on some files like `Permission Denied`, 
as a workaround, please use this and let us know so that we can update this 
repo.
```bash
  sudo chmod 666 <your-filename> 
```

If you face any other problems not mentioned above, please reach out to us.
